# Emacs configuration
### by Thibault Bronchain

- Edit dot.emacs and replace "/Users/thibaultbronchain/" by the right path to your user home
- install emacs

`$ cp dot.emacs ~/.emacs`

`$ cp -r dot.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d`

- check cheat sheet here http://www.rgrjr.com/emacs/emacs_cheat.html

Additional features:

- Switch between "windows' with: alt-arrows
- winner-mode activated: c-c arrows
- Many other stuff that you will appreciate for sure ...

Troobleshoot:

- There are often issues with meta key and OSX.
  A good idea is to define the "Option" key as "Meta" or "Esc+" in the terminal options.

Comments:

- This configuration is made on OSX, but should be easily adapted to any OS
- Don't hasitate to make some pull request if you want to improve it, I would really appreciate it
- I try to keep my configuration simple.
  It's not perfect, and I haven't written it all, but it's all I need.
  Once again, you're welcome to contribute!
